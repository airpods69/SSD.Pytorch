The dataset includes 51 images.
Or-tools are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -41째 to +41째 horizontally and -30째 to +30째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 7 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -52 and +52 percent
